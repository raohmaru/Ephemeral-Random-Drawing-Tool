# Ephemeral Random Drawing Tool
A sample tool to show the basics of the [HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API),
coded in plain JavaScript. No libraries except for the [requestAnimationFrame polyfill](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671).

Move the mouse or use the keyboard arrows to draw random shapes of random colours and random size
with an endless paint brush, in a canvas that erases itself. Your drawings while lasts a few seconds
on the screen, that becomes an random, ephemeral work of art.

+ `grunt build` builds the production version with the source minified (run with `--dev` to minify
nothing).
